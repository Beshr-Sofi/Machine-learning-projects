## 📘 Current Topics

### 1. Linear Regression
- Implemented Linear Regression using:
  - Gradient Descent
  - Normal Equation
- Visualized cost function convergence and regression fit.
- Explored feature scaling and learning rate effects.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Implemented Logistic Regression for binary classification.
- Used gradient descent optimization and regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Visualized decision boundaries and model performance.
